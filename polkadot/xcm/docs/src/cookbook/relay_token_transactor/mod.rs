//! # Relay Asset Transactor
//!
//! This example shows how to configure a parachain to only deal with the Relay Chain token.
//!
//! The first step is using the [`xcm_builder::FungibleAdapter`] to create an `AssetTransactor` that
//! can handle the relay chain token.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/cookbook/relay_token_transactor/parachain/xcm_config.rs", asset_transactor)]
//!
//! The second step is to configure `IsReserve` to recognize the relay chain as a reserve for its
//! own asset.
//! With this, you'll be able to easily mint a derivative asset, backed one-to-one from the Relay
//! Chain, by using the xcm pallet's `transfer_assets` extrinsic.
//!
//! The `IsReserve` type takes a type that implements `ContainsPair<MultiAsset, MultiLocation>`.
//! In this case, we want a type that contains the pair `(relay_chain_native_token, relay_chain)`.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/cookbook/relay_token_transactor/parachain/xcm_config.rs", is_reserve)]
//!
//! With this setup, we are able to do a reserve asset transfer to and from the parachain and relay
//! chain.
